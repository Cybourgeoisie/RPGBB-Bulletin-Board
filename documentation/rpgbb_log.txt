Weirdest bug ever. JQuery won't expand or contract the forum_block accurately if the forum_description isn't wide enough to hit the floating elements to the right (the thread posts, etc).

All throughout development, I will keep in mind the jQuery and language elements.

Thought about it, going to make a new framework. Starting with security overlay.

Thinking about rewriting a lot of TRH to suit the forum module

Cleaning up TRH web application framework for rpgBB, will replace plain JavaScript with jQuery

Started the project, laid out the ideal technology for rpgBB: 
	- php 5.0, mysql 4.1/5.0, jQuery 1.2.6 (Javascript framework), strict XHTML, clean CSS 3.0
	- likely use of AJAX
	- based on most recent version of The Rabbit Hole web application framework that I designed
